# NodeEmbeddingMethods
Implementation of 4 common node embeddings methods used in Graph Representation Learning: Spectral Clustering, node2vec, LINE, and GraRep.

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment. As of July 2025, the code works with Python 3.11.9.

To run all 4 node embeddings and compare their performance, run ```python -u run_all.py -p1 _withincluster1probability_ -p2 _withincluster2probability_ -p3 _withincluster3probability_```, where ```-p1```, ```-p2```, & ```-p3``` represent the probability of nodes in the same cluster (cluster 1, 2, and 3, respectively) of the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) being connected to each other by an edge. Run the previous command from the repository's root directory. This file runs each method on the same network, which has 1000 nodes and is generated by a SBM with 3 clusters. To compare method performance, the NMI score between the predicted (by KMeans) and actual cluster labels for each node is calculated.

If you would like to change the parameters for LINE or GraRep, you can do so directly in ```run_all.py```. To see the full list of parameters for those methods, go to their corresponding ```config.py``` file.

## Instructions

Implementation of 4 common node embedding methods used in Graph Representation Learning: Spectral Clustering, node2vec, LINE, and GraRep.

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment. As of July 2025, the code works with Python 3.11.9.

To run all 4 embedding methods and compare their performance, run ```python -u run_all.py -p1 _withincluster1probability_ -p2 _withincluster2probability_ -p3 _withincluster3probability_```, where ```-p1```, ```-p2```, & ```-p3``` represent the probability of nodes in the same cluster (cluster 1, 2, and 3, respectively) of the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) being connected to each other by an edge. Run this command from the repository's root directory. ```run_all.py``` runs each method on the same network, which has 1000 nodes and is generated by an SBM with 3 clusters. The NMI score between the predicted (by KMeans) and actual cluster labels is calculated for each embedding method and saved in ```nmi_scores.csv```.

If you would like to change the parameters for LINE or GraRep, you can do so directly in ```run_all.py```. To see the full list of parameters for those methods, go to their corresponding ```config.py``` file.

Additionally, you can run ```run_all_density.py``` followed by ```plot_all_density.py``` to see how the NMI scores for each embedding method change as the density of the network changes. The network densities are controlled by the within-cluster probabilities, which are given default values of 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, & 0.9 in ```run_all_density.py```. If you would like to try different network densities, you can manually change the within-cluster probabilities in ```run_all_density.py```. ```plot_all_density.py``` produces a plot summarizing these results.

# NodeEmbeddingMethods
Implementation of 4 common node embeddings methods used in Graph Representation Learning: Spectral Clustering, node2vec, LINE, and GraRep.

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment. As of July 2025, the code works with Python 3.11.9.

To run all 4 node embeddings and compare their performance, run ```python -u run_all.py``` from the repository's root directory.
